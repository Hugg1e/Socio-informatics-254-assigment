                <p>GeoCities was a web hosting service that allowed user to create, publish and view user created websites for free. They could view these websites by their interest and theme. Originally the users had to pick a "city" in which to list the hyperlinks to their web pages. The "cities" named after real cities and regions according to what content would be found on these webpages: for example Athens and Acropolis was used for anything teaching, education, reading, writing and philosophy related. This webpage aims to explore and Geocity websites by creating 5 different webpages based on the GeoCity neibourhood and topic.</p>
