                <h2>Plot</h2>
                <p>The plot is told from two different points of view, the first is the point of view of Jules
                    Winnfield (Samuel L.Jackson) and Vincent Vega(John Travolta) two hitmen who have been tasked by
                    their employer, mob boss Marsellus Wallace(ving Rhames) to retrieve a stolen suitcase. The other
                    point of view is the point of view of Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) an aging boxer who is paid
                    by Wallace to lose fights. The two different points of view and the characters alongside them
                    are intertwined creating a series of bizarre incidents.</p>

                <h2>Acting</h2>
                <p>The acting in this film is phenomenal, The killer duo performance done by Samuel L Jackson and
                    John Travolta is amazing, their character and chemistry just bounce right off eachother in the
                    most brilliant ways, they complement eachother so well. Bruce Willis's performance as the ageing
                    Boxer Butch Coolidge who refuses to give up and give in is one of his best A-list performance
                    outshining his later mediocre films. Ving Rhames plays the more controversial roll Marsellus
                    Wallace really well giving a rather shocking but brilliant performance </p>

        <h2>Cinematography</h2>
        <p>Quentin Tarantino never misses with his cinematography and direction of his films, having Andrzej Sekula
            doing the cinamatography of the film, each shot significantly enhances the experience and adds to the
            direction of his story telling, the man really has a keen eye for cinamatography and makes the best out
            of it in Pulp fiction specifically, allowing the film to age extremely well. Some of the beautiful shots can
            be seen below </p>

        <img src="../Images/cinematography-hollywood-image 2.jpg" alt="cinematography image 2" width="100%"
            height="100%">
        <p>The cinamatography shines when the duo is shown, it encapsulates the similarities between the two but also
            the stark contrast between the two. The cinamatography and direction of this film is incomparable to others
            of the time.</p>
